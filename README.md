# Finding_similar_items_machine_learning

Arcada UAS | Project: finding similar items (machine learning) | Tools: Python | Score: 4.0/5.0 | Project is about to find the frequent items and their item clusters by using different algorithms, thresholds, tuple sizes
- Found similar items using pair-wise comparisons, MinHash (vectorized version) and LSH algorithms
- Tested different parameters, identified the clusters of similar abstracts 
- Evaluated the results, compared the performance of each algorithm, compared cosine distance and Jaccard distance for the vectorized MinHash algorithm
